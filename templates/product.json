For the past 20 years, Morasch Meats has been a leader in developing unique and high-quality products for the pet industry. In addition to the 85,000-square-foot primary facility, Morasch Meats proudly acquired an additional 90,000-square-foot facility where High-Pressure Processing and Freeze Drying for both human and pet products takes place. Morasch Meats has been on the cutting edge of advanced food processing technologies and will continue to be so well into the future.<br/><br/>In 2004, Morasch Meats founded Northwest Naturals as their own brand of raw frozen pet food.
